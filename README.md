## about
This sandbox was created 1/8/2023 to help me learn about Git and GitHub

## markdown language
Markdown is a language used in FILENAME.md files such as this README.md file.
[This cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) tells you all you need to know about the markdown language.

## cloning
Having created the sandbox1 repository on the GitHub website, I then did the following to clone it to my local computer

`git clone https://github.com/GraemeMcRae/sandbox1.git sandbox1`

Then I made this "cloning" section in this README.md file, did a git add, git commit, git push to synchronize everything. Nice.
